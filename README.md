## 4. Detailed Processes and Case Study

### Customer Registration and SIM Allocation

#### Step 1: Identity Verification

* Verify identity using national ID (e.g., Aadhaar)
* Check the IDâ€™s validity in the system

#### Step 2: Check Existing Connections

* System checks how many SIMs are already registered to the ID
* If the user has 9 SIMs: request is denied
* If under the limit: continue registration

#### Scenario A: New Customer Registration

* Admin enters new customer details
* Upon successful verification, a new Cust\_ID is generated
* Customer selects a plan, and a SIM is issued (new RegSim entry)

#### Scenario B: Existing Customer Gets a New SIM

* Admin searches customer by phone number or Cust\_ID
* System repeats identity and SIM limit check
* If allowed, new RegSim entry is created with a selected plan

### Billing and Payment Cycle

#### Bill Generation

* On a fixed day each month (e.g., 1st), the system:

  * Calculates total due for each active postpaid SIM
  * Adds plan fee, extra usage charges, taxes
  * Stores bill in the Bill table

#### Notifications

* System notifies customers via SMS and email about generated bills and due dates

#### Reminders

* First reminder is sent a few days before the due date
* Second reminder after due date if still unpaid

#### Recording Payment

* When payment is made, it is recorded in the Payment table
* Bill status is automatically updated to "Paid"

### Service Deactivation and Reactivation

#### Deactivation Triggers

* Non-payment beyond grace period (e.g., 15 days)
* Customer requests temporary suspension
* Security concerns or fraudulent usage

#### Reactivation

* After dues are cleared
* Or as requested by the customer
* Reconnection fees may apply

#### Permanent Disconnection

* If a service remains unpaid and deactivated for over 90 days
* Number is permanently disconnected and may be reassigned
